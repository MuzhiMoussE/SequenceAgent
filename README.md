This project focuses on developing intelligent agents for the Sequence game. The core challenge lies in designing agents that operate under strict computational constraints while navigating the game's complexities: partial observability (hidden opponent hands), adversarial dynamics, and combinatorial action spaces.

Our approaches evolved through experimentation with two agents and four main AI methods:

- **Fast BFS** - Blind Search: Combines breadth-first search, and heuristic evaluation to decompose the game into tractable sub-problems.

- **Fast BFS** - Goal Recognition: Uses card counter to predict opponent threats and prioritize blocking.

- **Q-learning with MCTS** - Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS): Enhanced with domain-specific heuristic scores for biased rollouts.

- **Q-learning with MCTS** - Q-Learning: Trained offline for microsecond decision latency via state abstraction.

And we also introduced some deprecated methods that required some improvements.

Agents were iteratively refined through 40+ experimental matches, culminating in FastBFSâ€”the tournament-ready solution achieving 90% win rates (38/40 wins) and 6th place in class-wide competitions. This wiki documents our technical journey, from theoretical foundations to empirical breakthroughs.
